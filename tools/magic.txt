# I notice that SNES roms aren't identified by the `file` utility, while
# iNES and a few other types are. Would be nice to send the author a
# patch, but I need to figure out how to do complicated things with the
# magic format first.
#
# The SNES internal header location varies by mapper and the presence/absence
# of an SMC header, and there is no single definitive identifier. This runs
# the following checks at each possible header location; collectively they
# provide good confidence that the file is actually an SNES ROM:
#
# * That the reset interrupt vector (0x?FFC) points to a sane offset.
# * That the size byte (0x?FD7) is within the range used by official carts.
# * That the country code (0x?FD9) is also within the official range.
# * That the mapper type byte is among the known good values.
#
# The descriptor doesn't try to include everything in the header, just enough
# information to *find* the header. False positives are still possible. This
# could probably be improved with more checks.
