# I notice that SNES roms aren't identified by the `file` utility, while
# iNES and a few other types are. Would be nice to send the author a
# patch, but I need to figure out how to do complicated things with the
# magic format first.

# The below is awful and almost certainly full of false positives, but
# sort of works.
#
# The Right Thing is probably something like: mapmode byte matches its
# location, name is in the ascii range, rom size byte matches, not sure
# what else.
