# dat files to include in nointro.tsv
#
# For now, I am relying on an explicit list to (try to) prevent
# accidental removal from a given release. If any of these files are
# missing, builds will fail. Extras are ignored. Files are looked for in
# ~/.local/share/romtool/datomatic. Globs are used because the
# download adds a datestamp that we don't care about.
