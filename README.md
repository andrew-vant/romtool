# romtool/romlib

A game-independent ROM-editing API.

(and a simple frontend for using it)

## What is this?

Some people like to modify old games from the Age of Cartridges. Some
games have tools available for exactly that, such as [Lunar Magic][lm] for
Super Mario World. Such tools are usually for some specific game and do
not work for other games.

There are some tasks that are common to *any* game, though. For example,
the format of binary data structures may differ from one ROM to another,
but the act of digging that structure out and putting it in a form
someone can use is universal. Reading a string is not fundamentally
different from one game to another, either.

romlib (and its command line interface, romtool) is an attempt to
collect game-independent functionality into an API and a very basic
patch-making tool. The idea is to make simple hacks possible for
non-programmers, and provide a useful set of primitives for more complex
game-specific hacking tools.

Here are some things you can do with it that might be useful:

- Inspect ROM data tables, e.g. monster stats, dialogue strings, or
  spell lists.
- Edit the same in a spreadsheet, then make a patch implementing the
  changes.
- Version-control rom hacking projects. Romtool's dump format is TSV,
  and it supports a textualized, commentable IPS-ish input format.
  Both are quite friendly to version control tools.
- Merge multiple existing patches together.
- See what an existing patch actually changes.

Romlib does need to be told where to find the data it is going to
extract or patch. For this it needs a "rom map", which at the moment is
a set of .tsv files specifying the location and format of the data
structures in the ROM. My hope is that maps for romlib can eventually
serve as thorough, standardized, machine-readable documentation of how
different games' internals are structured.

romlib and romtool are still very, very alpha. At the moment it mainly
converts data tables from a rom into tsv files, which the user can edit
in any spreadsheet program and then generate an IPS patch from their
changes. This functionality is most likely to be useful for balance
patches to RPGs and other statistics-heavy games. The program is smart
enough to assemble multiple related data tables into joint objects, and
also to attach the appropriate name strings to them, as long as the
necessary locations and relations are included in the map.

Some additional features that have not been added yet, but that I want
to support. This isn't a complete list, just the things that come to
mind as I am writing:

- ROM expansion
- Header manipulation
- Empty-space search
- Game documentation generation
  - monster/item/equipment lists (for players)
  - data table specs (for romhackers)
- Alternate input and output formats
  - More than just tsv for maps.
  - More than just IPS for patches
- Archaeological tools
  - working out text encodings
  - locating strings
  - locating data arrays

## Installation

Romlib requires Python 3.4 or later. Install that first.

I haven't built pip or OS packages yet, mainly because I'm still not
sure if I want to break it into multiple packages. For now you can
install it using the provided setup.py script:

```sh
python setup.py install
```

If you want to fiddle with the code yourself, you should install in
development mode. Consider forking the repo on github, then working from
your fork:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yourghname/romlib.git
cd romlib
python setup.py develop
```

The installation process should place the `romtool` command somewhere in
your PATH, but I don't trust this yet and would like feedback.

## Usage

You can get help at any time with `romtool --help` or
`romtool <subcommand> --help`. Trust the help output more than this
section, because I may forget to update it from time to time.

You can add `--verbose` to any of the commands below to show more
information about what they're doing.

The following command will extract all known data from the ROM named
`some_game.smc`, and save it as .tsv files in `moddir`. Each file
contains a list of entities; for example, there may be a monsters.tsv
containing information about monsters, or a characters.tsv with
character stats.

```sh
romtool dump some_game.rom moddir
```

Note that you do not usually need to specify which rom map to use;
romtool will attempt to autodetect it. (for the time being, detection is
based on the No-Intro rom sets) If autodetection fails, you can force
romtool to use a map in a particular folder by appending `-m <mapdir>`
to the command.

After dumping is finished, make whatever changes you want to the files
in `moddir`. Any spreadsheet application should do the job; I use
LibreOffice, but Excel should also work. Be aware that you may have to
turn off any auto-formatting features, especially if you plan to edit
textual elements such as names.

When saving your changes, be sure you save them in place in .tsv format,
*not* .xls, .ods, .csv, or anything else. It's probably a good idea to
turn off autocorrect or similar features, too.

There are some limits to what you can change. For example, if a
monster's attack power is stored in the ROM as a single byte, you cannot
give it \>255 attack (the maximum single-byte value). If you're lucky,
romtool will complain. Not so lucky, and it will cheerfully make a patch
that breaks the game.

When you're done making changes, do this to preview the patch:

```sh
romtool build moddir --rom some_game.rom
```

This prints out a textualized version of the IPS patch that will result
from your changes. If you made a small change but get a huge patch,
something is wrong.

If it looks okay, you can build the actual patch with:

```sh
romtool build moddir --rom some_game.rom --out some_game.ips
```

That will create an IPS patch containing your changes. Give it the same
name as the ROM, but with a .ips extension (this will probably be the
default in future versions). The reason the name should match is that it
will cause some emulators (ZSNES and SNES9x at least, probably others)
to automatically make use of it, without physically modifying the
original ROM.

Now you can fire up an emulator and point it to the ROM. Assuming the
emulator supports implicit patching and your patch is named correctly,
you should see your changes in-game.

## Troubleshooting

**Q. ROM map detection failed. Why?**

Possible causes:

1. There may not be an available map for your ROM. At the moment only a
   few games are supported out of the box. If there isn't an existing
   map, you will have to create your own. I haven't written
   documentation for this process yet, but looking at the contents of
   the data/maps directory in the repo will probably be informative.
2. You may have an SNES ROM with an SMC header. The header changes the
   sha1 hash of the rom, which is what romlib uses to identify it.
   Remove the header and try again (eventually romtool will be able to
   do this for you).
3. The ROM may have been physically modified, perhaps by applying a
   patch to the file instead of relying on an emulator's implicit
   patching. If you are trying to dump data from a modified ROM, you
   can specify a map with the -m option.

**Q. My system doesn't know what program to use to open .tsv files.**

The tsv file type may not be associated with anything. The method for
associating filetypes differs by OS. On Windows 7 you can do it from the
file properties; look for "Opens With \<something>" followed by a button
marked 'Change'. Other Windows versions should be pretty similar. On
Linux you're on your own, but you probably Googled the answer before you
got here anyway.

**Q. The changes in my patch don't show up in-game.**

1. Your patch may be named incorrectly. It should usually have the same
   filename as the ROM, but with a .ips extension.
2. Your emulator may not support implicit patching. Either physically
   apply the patch with `romtool apply`, or use an emulator that does
   support it. Here is a list of emulators known to support implicit
   patching:

   - ZSNES
   - snes9x
   - FCEUX (name as romname.nes.ips instead of romname.ips)
   - FIXME: Add more here....

**Q. My patch changes produce garbage.**

Probably your spreadsheet application's autoformat function is trying to
be smart. Turn it off.

**Q. I already have a modified ROM and want to make a patch from it.**

Do this:

```sh
romtool diff original.rom modified.rom -o patch.ips
```

**Q. I have an IPS patch and want to see what's in it.**

Do this:

```sh
romtool merge patch.ips
```

(yes, I know that doesn't make sense. It's taking advantage of the fact
that the merge command accepts any number of patches, even just one; and
that by default it prints the merged changes to stdout. Needs syntactic
sugar.)

## Map Files

Notes on creating map files properly go here...

Notes: the various map spec files may have any number of extra columns
not used by romlib. This is intentional; extensions or client
applications can implement UI hints by looking for extra columns in the
spec.

(there probably needs to be a naming convention for app-specific columns
vs extension columns vs official columns...)

Maps in this repo that actually work:

- 7th Saga works fine
- FF1 works fine
- Lufia 2 dumps okay but I would be surprised if it creates patches
  okay.
- I think SMRPG worked last time I checked, not sure if it still does
