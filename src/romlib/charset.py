# Given a string and a byte stream, how do I know if it matches?
#
# Take all lowercase letters. Ensure they differ from each other in the manner
# one would expect. Repeat for uppercase letters. Repeat for digits. If all
# that matches, we have a hit. Create a dict mapping letters and symbols to
# bytes based on this bytestream and record it.

# Compare such mappings for
# multiple strings to get better accuracy and fill in additional characters; if
# there's a mismatch, something is wrong. If there isn't, we have most of our
# map, but probably not our terminator character.
