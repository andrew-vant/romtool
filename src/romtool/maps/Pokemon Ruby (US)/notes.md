## Warnings

While you can change species' ID's for the Hoenn and National Pokedexes,
be aware that there is a separate table that maps Hoenn entries to
National entries. If you change a species’ IDs, I think you must also
change the Hoenn-to-National map to match, or you will get
inconsistencies.

(I can’t think of a reason anyone would need to do that, but might as
well note it)
