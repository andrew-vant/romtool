Spell function.

This appears in spell data, and determines the spell’s combat behavior
and the meaning of its ‘effectivity’ field. It is probably an index into
a table of function pointers.

Spells that cannot be used in combat have spell function 0. I do not
know what determines out-of-combat spell behavior.
