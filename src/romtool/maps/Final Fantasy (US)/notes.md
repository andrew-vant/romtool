## Class Growth

Annoyingly, class growth doesn’t seem to be algorithmic. There’s a table
with one entry for each level; and each level-entry consists of six
sub-entries, one for each class. Each sub-entry is a bitfield indicating
the guaranteed stat bonuses for each class (otherwise it’s 25%) and any
magic-level slots gained.
