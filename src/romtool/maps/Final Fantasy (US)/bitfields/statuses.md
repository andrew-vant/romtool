Status effects applied by an attack.

This is distinct from the “Status” element. Some spells with the status
element do not inflict a status effect (e.g. FEAR), and some
status-inflicting spells carry a different element (e.g. STOP). The
latter is the main distinguishing factor of the many deathspells in the
game; they all apply the Death status, but carry different elements, so
they work on different targets.
