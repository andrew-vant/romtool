# an alternate approach: specify arguments and commands separately. Why
# not nest args in commands? Because we want command args that are "the
# same" to have matching confs and pull from the same line in the conf
# file.
#
# The aim here is to find a way to separate the "data schema" expected
# by the commands from the implementation details of how it's aquired
# (conf file, argparse, passing in a dict, whatever
#
# Implementation possibility: there's a chicken and egg situation where
# we need to parse the cli to get --conf, --debug, --verbose, etc, but
# we don't know the defaults until after reading --conf
#
# Possible solution: Parse the cli twice, once with only options, just
# to get --conf and --verbose (we can't parse partial args because it
# will miss things like the v in -vf). Positional args get ignored at
# this step. Then read the conf file if it's there, and re-parse the
# args with the conf file options as defaults. The only thing that needs
# customizing is "which argument to use as the config file arg"

# input:
#   rom:
#     # type defaults to str. `file` gets magic handling to build an
#     # argparse.filetype. Everything else gets looked up somehow, in
#     # locals() maybe?
